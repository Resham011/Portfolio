        On the development side, I work comfortably across the <strong>MERN stack</strong> to build full-stack web applications, but what truly excites me is applying ML to solve real-world problemsâ€”from recommendation engines to intelligent automation. I'm always looking to push boundaries, contribute to open-source projects, and stay at the forefront of AI and software innovation.
